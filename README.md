<h2>Description</h2>



Project consists of a report documenting the creation of a basic virtualised network infrastructure for a small company via open source networking software components such as Miniedit, to make the topology
and simulate a network through software, which was installed via a python script through the Ubuntu CLI. 

This was managed through a centralised network controller called Floodlight Openflow, acting as a server for virtualised network management. To analyse and confirm the intregrity of the packets, Wireshark was used,
as well as load balancing to test different functions and distributing traffic. As the final step, Curl was installed to access the additonal statistics and the rest API on the controller.
